# Angular Example using Guards and Permissions with Roles

Example of a footer component in a shared module in an Ionic project using Angular.

This way you can share the same footer in all ionic pages. With this solution you just have to include the following lines in every page where you want your footer after the ion-content element:

```
<ion-footer>
  <app-footer></app-footer>
</ion-footer>
```

## Getting Started

After cloning this project don't forget to:

```
npm install
```

After that:

```
cd ionic-angular-footer
ionic serve
```

Enjoy!!!
